Global Project Context: The D-E-N-O-A-P Newsletter System is an AI-driven news aggregation and distribution tool aimed at creating a fully autonomous newsletter system. It scrapes news articles from predefined sources, translates them into a target language using OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4 API, and sends them to subscribers via email. The system manages subscriptions through an API and operates automatically through scheduled tasks, ensuring seamless and scalable distribution of curated content.
